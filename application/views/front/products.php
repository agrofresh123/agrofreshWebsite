			  <h3>The IQF (Individual Quick Frozen) Processing Unit for frozen fruits and vegetables</h3>
			  <span>+</span>
			  <div class="panel">
				  <p>After gaining our stronghold on the fresh and processed fruits, <strong>Agro Fresh Foods</strong> took a step further by extending its product base with IQF products.  This new technique brought a complete revolution in the entire food industry.<br><br><strong>The IQF Process</strong><br>Whilst the products are in motion on IQF belt, they are individually quick frozen by blast freezing method. Individual pieces of food are passed over a conveyor belt and separately quick frozen by a blast freezer. This method ensures each part of the product gets frozen by attaining a uniform temperature of -18 to -21 degree Celsius.  This leaves each piece of fruits or vegetables separately frozen and not formed into a cohesive block. The damage occurring to products is minimised by keeping uniform air distribution throughout.<br><br>The IQF (Individually Quick Frozen) has completely replaced the traditional freezing method which had certain limitations to it. The traditional, slow freezing process was not only slow, but also caused the fruits and vegetables to get thawed. This meant damage to the internal cell structure because of the formation of large ice crystals. IQF, also known as flash freezing on the other hand maintains the original texture, nutrition, taste and freshness of the fruit.  It also eradicates the reprocessing and drop loss during re-freezing.<br><br>This quick freezing technique also breaks the limitations of seasonality because IQF fruits and vegetables have longer shelf life. You can maintain a continuous supply of seasonal fresh fruits and vegetables throughout the year.<br><br><strong>Agro Fresh Foods</strong> is equipped with completely advanced and automatic machineries for IQF processing with an hourly production of 1- 2 MT on an average.  We pack IQF products under most hygienic condition in 5 ply brown carton with neutral labels and inner blue unsealed poly, as per client requirements.<br><br><strong>Agro Fresh Foods</strong> provides frozen fruits and vegetables in different forms mostly as whole, half, slices, dices and tit bits. Our IQF product includes mango slices and dices for Alphonso and Totapuri varieties, coconut cubes, papaya slices/dices, pink guava dices and muskmelon slices/dices. In addition to this, you can also find frozen green peas, carrot dices, baby corn and sweet corn with us.</p>

			  <h3>More About Frozen Fruits and Vegetables</h3>
			  <span>+</span>
			  <div class="panel">
				  <p><strong>What is IQF?</strong><br>
        Abbreviated from Individually Quick Frozen, IQF is a technique under which each individual piece of food is frozen separately.<br><br>
                        <strong>Why IQF?</strong><br>
        Rather than freezing food pieces together and making a block of it, each food piece is chilled individually. This terrific technology makes IQF fruits and vegetables much easier to work with.<br><br>
        <strong>Agro Fresh Foods – Trusted frozen fruit manufacturer and exporter</strong><br>
        Our exclusive range of IQF fruits and vegetables attract customers from around the world. Each of our frozen products offers long lasting freshness, taste and texture which make our brand presence felt across the globe.<br><br>
        Our best quality <strong>IQF fruits and vegetables</strong> are popular for following high quality <u>standards</u>.  We provide everything right from the diced, sliced forms to completely frozen IQF variety of fruits and vegetables and that too at the most competitive price.<br><br>
        Being a bulk quantity <strong>exporter</strong> of IQF food products, <strong>Agro Fresh Foods</strong> never overlooks Quality. Only fruits and vegetables that are free from genetic modifications are selected to be frozen. They are also inspected thoroughly and washed before turning them into chilled delights.<br><br>
        Along with quality standards followed for IQF, emphasis is also laid on best packaging. The packing of IQF Fruits and Vegetables ensures that the flavor and quality of the offering remains intact.<br><br></p>

                                <p><strong>IQF Sweet Corn</strong> Sweet corn, also known as sugar corn is a variety of maize with high sugar content. Unlike field corn varieties, which are harvested when the kernels are dry and mature, sweet corn is picked when immature (at milk stage) and prepared and eaten as a vegetable, rather than a grain. Since the process of maturation of sweet corn involves converting sugar to starch, sweet corn needs consumed fresh or canned or frozen before the kernels become tough and starchy.<br><br>To provide rich taste of sweet corn we manufacture IQF sweet corn kernels by de-husking and de-kernelling the matured, soft, juicy and tender sorted cobs of sweet corn. Free flowing kernels are separated manually, washed, blanched and dewatered. The acquired product is then passed through individual quick freezer (IQF) or blast freezer at -40°C and then sieved, inspected, packed and passed through metal detector. Overall, the process is carried out maintaining strict hygienic conditions throughout processing line.<br><br><strong>Specification:</strong><br><br></p>

                                <p><br><br><strong>White Guava Puree Concentrate</strong><br><br> At <strong>Agro Fresh Foods</strong>, we produce one of the best white guava puree concentrate from the creamy white variety of guavas, grown in the tropical regions of North India. Guavas with faint brown spots covering the outer skin are preferred for extracting puree concentrate. It is manufactured through an exhaustive process where the fruits are first inspected, washed and blanched. This deactivates all the oxidative enzymes. After blanching, the residue passes through a screw paddle which maximizes the pulp extraction.<br><br>The quality rich puree is then heated and blended for a considerable time at a resistant temperature. The processed guava puree concentrate is then packed into aseptic bag or drums using a polyliner. The de-aerated guava puree concentrate is more hygienic and has a better shelf life as it can retain even small amounts of ascorbic acid in it.<br><br>With quality standards ensured, we at <strong>Agro Fresh Foods</strong> export maximum quantity of puree concentrates. Guava puree concentrate can be used for making candies, preserves, jellies, jams, marmalades, juices, nectars, baby food, beverages, ice-cream, sauces, snacks and cereal bars.<br><br></p>

                                <p><strong>Banana Puree</strong> We process banana puree or banana pulp from a selected variety of banana grown in the sub-tropical regions of South India. The Cavendish banana puree (banana pulp) obtained from Indian bananas is considered best owing to its superior size, rich flavour and thickness. Selected bananas are hand peeled, pumped through series of filters and finally mashed to get a banana puree. It is then homogenized, de-aerated and sterilized according to international standards. The fresh aseptic banana puree is free from any chemicals or preservatives.<br><br>Banana fruit puree contains sucrose, fructose, glucose and fibre. It also contains high level of iron, vitamin C, A1, B6, B12 and potassium. All these nutrients help prevent substantial illnesses like blood-pressure, depression, obesity, stress, strokes and intestinal disorders. We export superior quality banana puree which can be widely used in juices, nectars, drinks, jams, bakery fillings, baby foods, ice creams and yoghurts.<br><br>Single Strength Banana Puree Specifications:<br></p>

                                <p><strong>White Guava Puree Concentrate</strong><br><br> At <strong>Agro Fresh Foods</strong>, we produce one of the best white guava puree concentrate from the creamy white variety of guavas, grown in the tropical regions of North India. Guavas with faint brown spots covering the outer skin are preferred for extracting puree concentrate. It is manufactured through an exhaustive process where the fruits are first inspected, washed and blanched. This deactivates all the oxidative enzymes. After blanching, the residue passes through a screw paddle which maximizes the pulp extraction.<br><br>The quality rich puree is then heated and blended for a considerable time at a resistant temperature. The processed guava puree concentrate is then packed into aseptic bag or drums using a polyliner. The de-aerated guava puree concentrate is more hygienic and has a better shelf life as it can retain even small amounts of ascorbic acid in it.<br><br>With quality standards ensured, we at <strong>Agro Fresh Foods</strong> export maximum quantity of puree concentrates. Guava puree concentrate can be used for making candies, preserves, jellies, jams, marmalades, juices, nectars, baby food, beverages, ice-cream, sauces, snacks and cereal bars.<br><br></p>

                                <p><strong>Tomato Paste<br><br></strong> Tomato paste or tomato puree concentrate is produced from quality tomatoes of India"s largest tomato growing state, Karnataka. The ripened tomatoes are processed through series of steps where they are selected, washed, crushed and blanched to deactivate the enzymes. The foreign content from tomato paste, like the skin and seeds is discarded and finally passed through concentrating machine to reduce the water content through evaporation process.<br><br>By following innovative methods we are able to retain the flavour, colour and richness of tomatoes in the puree concentrate. The processed tomato paste or tomato puree concentrate is then packed into large aseptic containers. With excellent quality, rich consistency and fruit content, our tomato paste can be used in soups, stews, sauces, and many more dishes.<br><br><strong>Tomato Paste Specifications:</strong><br></p>
